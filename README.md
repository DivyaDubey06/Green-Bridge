Eco Project: GreenBridge

GreenBridge is a small eco-focused project built to bring together NGOs, volunteers, and users who want to contribute to environmental activities. The idea is to create a simple platform where basic information can be managed, viewed, and expanded over time. The project includes both frontend and backend so it can grow into a complete system later.

*What This Project Does*
The project currently handles basic eco-related modules such as NGOs and volunteers.
The backend manages the data and API logic, while the frontend handles the user interface.
Right now, the focus is on keeping everything simple and readable rather than adding heavy features.

*Technologies Used*:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB (through Mongoose)

*How to Run*

Backend
Install dependencies:
npm install
Start the server:
node server.js

The server will start on the port defined inside the file.

Frontend
Just open your main HTML file (like index.html) in the browser.
No build tools are required.

*Purpose of the Project*:

The main purpose of GreenBridge is to act as a foundation for an eco-awareness platform.
It is meant to:

1. Provide basic information about NGOs and volunteers
2.Keep data organised through a simple backend
3.Allow easy UI updates through the frontend
4.Serve as a base for adding more features like events, donations, or reporting in the future

Future Plans:
You can continue expanding this project by adding:
Event pages
Donation handling
User accounts
Image uploads
Admin dashboards
Better frontend design
Provide certifications
